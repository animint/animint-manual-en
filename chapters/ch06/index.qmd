# New features

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path="ch06-figures/")
```

This chapter gives a complete list of new features in `animint2`, beyond what is present in `ggplot2`.
After reading this chapter, you will understand how to customize your `animint2` graphics via

* the `href`, `tooltip`, `id` aesthetics for observation-specific
  characteristics;
* named elements of `clickSelects` and `showSelected` for specifying
  several selection variables at once;
* new geoms: `tallrect`, `widerect`, `label_aligned`;
* the `chunk_vars` geom-specific option;
* the `color_off`, `fill_off`, and `alpha_off` geom parameters for
  specifying how selection state is displayed;
* the `help` and `title` geom-specific parameters, which can be set to
  text strings that will be shown in the guided tour;
* plot-specific options for legends, HTML table layout, and height/width;
* global options such as `duration`, `title`, and `source`.

## Observation-specific options (new aesthetics) {#new-aesthetics}

This section explains the new aesthetics that are recognized by `animint2`.

### Review of previously introduced aesthetics {#review-aesthetics}

First we discuss the new aesthetics that we have already introduced in
previous chapters.

[Chapter 3](/ch03#duration-key) also introduced
`aes(key)` to designate a variable to use for smooth transitions that
are interpretable.

### Hyperlinks using `aes(href)` {#aes-href}

The code below uses `animint2` to draw a map of the United States. 

```{r ch06-viz-href}
library(animint2)
USpolygons <- map_data("state")
animint(
  map=ggplot()+
    ggtitle("click a state to read its Wikipedia page")+
    coord_equal()+
    geom_polygon(aes(
      x=long, y=lat, group=group,
      href=paste0("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/", region)),
      data=USpolygons, fill="black", colour="grey"))
```

Try clicking a state in the data viz above. You should see the
corresponding wikipedia page open in a new tab.

### Tooltips using `aes(tooltip)` {#aes-tooltip}

Tooltips are little windows of text information that appear when you
hover the cursor over something on the screen. In `animint2` you can use
`aes(tooltip)` to designate the observation-specific message that 
appears. For example we use it to display the population and country
name in the scatterplot of the World Bank data below.

```{r ch06-viz-tooltip}
data(WorldBank)
WorldBank1975 <- subset(WorldBank, year == 1975)
animint(
  scatter=ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      x=life.expectancy, y=fertility.rate,
      tooltip=paste(country, "population =", population)),
      size=5,
      data=WorldBank1975))
```

Try hovering the cursor over one of the data points. You should see a
small box appear with the country name and population for that data
point.

Note that a tooltip of the form "variable value" is specified by
default for each geom with `aes(clickSelects)`. For example a geom
with `aes(clickSelects=year)` shows the default tooltip "year
1984" for an observation with year 1984. You can change this
default by explicitly specifying `aes(tooltip)`.

### HTML id attribute using `aes(id)` {#aes-id}

Since everything plotted by `animint2` is rendered as an
[SVG](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp) element in a web
page, you may want to specify a
[HTML id attribute](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_id.asp)
using `aes(id)` as below.

```{r ch06-viz-id}
animint(
  map=ggplot()+
    ggtitle("each state/region/group has a unique id")+
    coord_equal()+
    geom_polygon(aes(
      x=long, y=lat, group=group,
      id=gsub(" ", "_", paste(region, group))),
      data=USpolygons, fill="black", colour="grey"))
```

Note how `gsub` is used to convert spaces to underscores, since a
well-defined id must not include spaces. Note also that `paste` is
used to add a group number, since there may be more than one polygon
per state/region, and each id must be unique on a web page. The
`animint2` developers use this feature
[for testing the animint JavaScript renderer code](https://github.com/tdhock/animint/wiki/Testing).

### Data compression using `aes(group)` {#aes-group}

Data compression can be useful for efficient storage and download of large data sets that have common data across different chunks (TSV files for different values of `showSelected` variables).
Normally `aes(group)` is used to define different lines, paths, polygons, or ribbons.
In `animint2` it has a secondary usage, for defining how to perform data compression (and can be used with other geoms).
It should be set to a grouping variable that has common data across different `showSelected` subsets.
Consider the following simple example: we have monthly data for a number of years and countries.

```{r}
library(data.table)
month.dt <- rbind(
  data.table(year=1, month=10:12),
  data.table(year=2, month=1:12),
  data.table(year=3, month=1:5))
set.seed(1)
country.dt <- rbind(
  data.table(month.dt, country="USA")[, value := rnorm(.N, 5)][-.N],
  data.table(month.dt, country="Canada")[, value := rnorm(.N, 9)][-1])
country.dt
```

The output above shows a table with one row per month and country.
We use these data in the visualization below.

```{r ch06-viz-group}
animint(
  ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      month, value, color=country),
      data=country.dt,
      showSelected="year"))
```

This data visualization contains two columns with common data values across years which could be compressed:

* `country` is either USA or Canada.
* `month` is an integer from 1 to 12.

To analyze the different kinds of compression we can attempt, we define a helper function, which will compile the animint and then summarize its TSV files.

```{r}
animint_tsv <- function(...){
  viz <- animint(...)
  info <- animint2dir(viz, "ch06tsv")
  tsv.files <- Sys.glob(file.path(info$out.dir,"*.tsv"))
  sapply(tsv.files, fread, simplify=FALSE)
}
```

Below we use the function to analyze the previous visualization,

```{r}
animint_tsv(
  ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      month, value, color=country),
      data=country.dt,
      showSelected="year"))
```

The output above shows a list of one data table, which means that there is only one TSV file output by default, since this is a relatively small data set.
Compression is not used when there is only one TSV file output.
To study compression, we force creating a separate file for each year, by adding the [`chunk_vars` parameter](#chunk-vars):

```{r}
animint_tsv(
  ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      month, value, color=country),
      data=country.dt,
      chunk_vars="year",
      showSelected="year"))
```

The output above is a list of three data tables, one for each year.
Compared to the previous example, there is one missing column, `showSelected1`, which was used for `year` values, and is no longer necessary (because the column would be constant in each file).
To enable compression in these data, we specify `aes(group=country)` in the code below.
This tells the compiler to check if there are common data values for each `country`, across the different values of `year`.

```{r}
animint_tsv(
  ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      month, value, color=country, group=country),
      data=country.dt,
      chunk_vars="year",
      showSelected="year"))
```

The output above is a list of four data tables which exhibit compression based on one common value for each group (country), across `showSelected` subsets (years).

* The first three are numbered chunks, one for each year, and columns `group`, `x`, `y`. These are the columns which have different values in each group (`x` and `y` are different for each country, across years).
* The last one is the common chunk, with one row per country/group, and columns `group`, `colour`, `fill`, `showSelected2`. These are the columns which have common values in each group (same for each country, across years).

Below we use `aes(group=month)` for comparison:

```{r}
animint_tsv(
  ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      month, value, color=country, group=month),
      data=country.dt,
      chunk_vars="year",
      showSelected="year"))
```

The output above is a list of three data tables (all numbered chunks), with no common chunk TSV file.
Compression was not used in this case, because there is only one column (`x`) with one common value in each group/month, across years.
To get compression when `group=month`, we would need at least two variables that are specific to each group across years, as shown in the example below, which changes `aes(color)`.

```{r}
animint_tsv(
  ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      month, value, color=month, group=month),
      data=country.dt,
      chunk_vars="year",
      showSelected="year"))
```

The output above is a list of four data tables which exhibit another example of compression, again based on one common value for each group (this time each month), across `showSelected` subsets (years as before).

* The first three are numbered chunks, one for each year, and columns `group`, `y`. The only column which has different values in each group/month across years is `y`.
* The last one is the common chunk, with one row per country/month, and columns `group`, `colour`, `fill`, `x`. These are the columns which have one common value in each group (same for each month, across years).

Below we show an example of how compression works with `geom_path()`, for which `aes(group)` is also used to determine how to draw different paths.
We also change `color` and `group` back to `country`:

```{r}
animint_tsv(
  ggplot()+
    geom_path(aes(
      month, value, color=country, group=country),
      data=country.dt,
      chunk_vars="year",
      showSelected="year"))
```

Above we see a common chunk data table with columns for `group`, `colour`, and `showSelected2`. This example of compression is the same as the first example above (same constant value for each group/country, across years).

The previous examples demonstrate how compression can be used if each group has a common scalar value across `showSelected` subsets. Another method is when each group has a common vector of values across `showSelected` subsets, which we would need to use if we wanted `x` to be considered common data in the `geom_path()`  example.
We would need to create a new data set,

* with an identical `x=month` vector in each group,
* and missing values in some elements of `y=value`,

We create the new data set with missing values in the code below.
We use `CJ` (cross join) to get a new data table with 72 rows (one for each unique combination of `country`, `year`, `month`).

```{r}
(na.dt <- country.dt[CJ(country,year,month,unique=TRUE), on=.NATURAL])
```

As expected, the output above shows `NA` in the `value` column.
Below, we use this data table in the same `geom_path()` code as in the previous example.

```{r}
animint_tsv(
  ggplot()+
    geom_path(aes(
      month, value, color=country, group=country),
      data=na.dt,
      chunk_vars="year",
      showSelected="year"))
```

The output above shows a common chunk data table with columns for `group`, `colour`, `showSelected2`, and `x`.

* `x` has different values in each row, indicating that it contains the vector of values which is common for each country, across years.
* `colour` and `showSelected2` have the same value in each row. These are the single values which are common for each country, across years.

Also note above that the `chunk1.tsv` file has columns `row_in_group` and `na_group` which are used to join these data with the common chunk file. These columns are not necessary in the other two chunks, because there are no missing values at the beginning of the data sequence.

The previous examples show that there are various parameters that can be used to control data compression:

* `chunk_vars` define the `showSelected` variables used to split the data into different TSV files.
* `aes(group)` should be set to a grouping variable that has common data across chunks.
* Explicit missing values (`NA`) can be used if you want a vector of values in the common chunk, or implicit missing values (removing rows) can be used if you want only constant values in the common chunk.

The best choices for each of these parameters will be different for each data set. Typically they are chosen in order to minimize disk usage, and thereby minimize download times.

## New geoms {#new-geoms}

There are several new geoms in `animint2`, with respect to the geoms that are provided in `ggplot2`.

### Tall and wide rectangles for selection {#tall-wide-rect}

Tall and wide rectangles are special cases of `geom_rect` which by default cover the entire Y/X range.

* `geom_tallrect()` covers the entire Y range, and was first introduced in [Chapter 4](/ch04).
* `geom_widerect()` covers the entire X range, and is discussed in [Chapter 8](/ch08).

Both are useful in combination with `clickSelects`, so we also provide helper functions for this common use case:

* `make_tallrect(data, "x_variable")` creates a rectangle for each unique value of the column with name `x_variable` in `data`.
* `make_widerect(data, "y_variable")` creates a rectangle for each unique value of the column with name `y_variable` in `data`.

Both of these are capable of showing smooth transitions for the selected rectangle, as in the [WorldBank data visualization with two time series facets](https://tdhock.github.io/2025-01-WorldBank-facets-map/).

* a expanded data set with `N^2` rows is computed for `N` unique values to select.
* there are `N` sets of rows, each with a different `showSelected` value.
* in each `showSelected` subset, the selected value has a special `aes(key)` value.
* so the result is a smooth transition: when we change the selection, we see the selected/special row moving to its new position (and all of the others are invisible).

For more discussion about this technique, see [Chapter 11](/ch11).

### Aligned labels for avoiding overlapping text {#geom-text-aligned}

When using multiple selection, it is often useful to display text labels to indicate the items in the selection set.
When labels are aligned (with the same X or Y value), then `geom_label_aligned()` can be used to adjust positions, to avoid overlapping labels.
For example, the [WorldBank data visualization](https://tdhock.github.io/2025-01-WorldBank-facets-map/) shows a text label before the first year of each selected country's time series.
For more discussion about this technique, see [Chapter 8](/ch08).

## Geom options {#geom-options}

In `animint2`, there are several options for customization at the geom
level: `chunk_vars` is used to specify how to split data sets for
storage on disk, and `*_off` parameters are used to specify how a
clickSelects geom should be displayed when it is not selected.
Additionally, `help` and `title` may be specified, to add information
to the guided tour.

### The `chunk_vars` geom-specific compilation option {#chunk-vars}

The `chunk_vars` option defines the selection variables that are used
to split the data set into separate chunks (TSV files) to
download. There is one TSV file created for each combination of values
of the `chunk_vars` variables. More selection variables specified in
`chunk_vars` means to split the data set into more TSV files, each of
a smaller size.

The `chunk_vars` option should be specified as an argument to a
`geom_*` function, and its value should be a character vector of
selection variable names. When `chunk_vars=character(0)`, a character
vector of length zero, all of the data is stored in a single TSV
file. When `chunk_vars` is set to all of the `showSelected` variable
names, then a TSV file is created for each combination of values of
those variables.

In general the `animint2dir()` compiler chooses a sensible default for
`chunk_vars`, but you may want to specify `chunk_vars` if the data viz
is loading slowly, or taking up too much space on disk. If the data
viz is loading slowly, you should add selection variables to
`chunk_vars` to reduce the size of the first TSV file to download. If
the data viz takes up too much space on disk, you should remove
selection variables from `chunk_vars` to decrease the number of TSV
files. Lots of small TSV files can take more disk space than a single
TSV file because some filesystems store a constant amount of metadata
for every file.

To illustrate the usage of `chunk_vars`, consider the following
visualization of the `breakpoints` data set.

![Sketch of breakpoints data visualization](ch06-viz-breakpoints.png)

The sketch above consists of two plots. We begin by creating the plot
of error curves on the left.

```{r ch06-errorPlot}
data(breakpoints)
only.error <- subset(breakpoints$error, type=="E")
only.segments <- subset(only.error,bases.per.probe==bases.per.probe[1])
fp.fn.names <- rbind(
  data.table(error.type="false positives", type="FP"),
  data.table(error.type="false negatives", type=c("I", "FN")))
error.dt <- data.table(breakpoints$error)
error.type.dt <- error.dt[fp.fn.names, on=list(type)]
fp.fn.dt <- error.type.dt[, list(
  error.value=sum(error)
), by=.(error.type, segments, bases.per.probe)]
errorPlot <- ggplot()+
  ggtitle("select data and segments")+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_tallrect(aes(
    xmin=segments-0.5, xmax=segments+0.5),
    clickSelects="segments",
    data=only.segments,
    alpha=1/2)+
  geom_line(aes(
    segments, error.value, color=error.type,
    group=paste(bases.per.probe, error.type)),
    showSelected="bases.per.probe",
    data=fp.fn.dt,
    size=5)+
  scale_color_manual(values=c(
    "false positives"="red", "false negatives"="blue"))+
  geom_line(aes(
    segments, error, group=bases.per.probe),
    clickSelects="bases.per.probe",
    data=only.error,
    size=4)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1, 6, 10, 20))
errorPlot
```

The plot above includes a `geom_tallrect` with `clickSelects=segments`
and a `geom_line` with `clickSelects=bases.per.probe`. It will be used
to select the data and model in the plot below.

```{r ch06-signalPlot}
signalPlot <- ggplot()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(panel.margin=grid::unit(0, "lines"))+
  theme_animint(last_in_row=TRUE)+
  geom_point(aes(
    position/1e5, signal),
    showSelected="bases.per.probe",
    shape=1,
    data=breakpoints$signals)+
  geom_segment(aes(
    first.base/1e5, mean, xend=last.base/1e5, yend=mean),
    showSelected=c("segments", "bases.per.probe"),
    color="green",
    data=breakpoints$segments)
signalPlot+facet_grid(segments ~ bases.per.probe)
```

The non-interactive plot above has 80 facets, one for each combination
of the two `showSelected` variables, `bases.per.probe` and
`segments`. Below we make an interactive version in which only one of
these facets will be shown.

```{r ch06-viz-chunk-vars}
(viz.chunk.vars <- animint(
  errorPlot,
  signal=signalPlot+
    geom_vline(aes(
      xintercept=base/1e5),
      showSelected=c("segments", "bases.per.probe"),
      color="green",
      chunk_vars=character(),
      linetype="dashed",
      data=breakpoints$breaks)))
```

Click the "Show download status table" button, and you should see
counts of chunks (TSV files). Note that `geom6_vline_signal` has only
1 chunk, since `chunk_vars=character()` is specified for the
`geom_vline` in the R code above. If another value of `chunk_vars` was
specified, it would create a different number of TSV files, but the
appearance of the data viz should be the same.

Below we use the `du` command line program to determine the disk usage
of the data viz for different choices of `chunk_vars`.

```{r tsvSizes}
tsvSizes <- function(segment.chunk.vars){
  viz <- list(
    error=errorPlot,
    signal=signalPlot+
      geom_vline(aes(
        xintercept=base/1e5),
        showSelected=c("segments", "bases.per.probe"),
        color="green",
        chunk_vars=segment.chunk.vars,
        linetype="dashed",
        data=breakpoints$breaks)
  )
  info <- animint2dir(viz, open.browser=FALSE)
  cmd <- paste("du -ks", info$out.dir)
  kb.dt <- fread(cmd=cmd)
  setnames(kb.dt, c("kb", "dir"))
  tsv.vec <- Sys.glob(paste0(info$out.dir, "/*.tsv"))
  is.geom6 <- grepl("geom6", tsv.vec)
  data.frame(
    kb=kb.dt$kb,
    geom6.tsv=sum(is.geom6),
    other.tsv=sum(!is.geom6))
}
chunk_vars_list <- list(
  neither=c(),
  bases.per.probe=c("bases.per.probe"),
  segments=c("segments"),
  both=c("segments", "bases.per.probe"))
sizes.list <- lapply(chunk_vars_list, tsvSizes)
(sizes <- do.call(rbind, sizes.list))
```

The table above includes counts of kilobytes for the data viz, along
with counts of TSV files for `geom6_vline_signal` and the other
geoms. Note how the choice of `chunk_vars` affects the number of TSV
files and the disk space usage. Since `chunk_vars` was only specified
for `geom6_vline_signal`, the number of TSV files for the other geoms
does not change. When both `segments` and `bases.per.probe` are
specified for `chunk_vars`, there are 76 TSV files for
`geom6_vline_signal`, and the data viz takes `r sizes["both", "kb"]`
kilobytes. In contrast, `chunk_vars=character()` produces only one TSV
file for `geom6_vline_signal`, and the data viz uses 
`r sizes["neither", "kb"]` kilobytes.

In conclusion, the geom-specific `chunk_vars` option defines the
number of TSV files created for each geom. When deciding the value of
`chunk_vars`, you should consider both disk usage and loading time. A
few large files take up less disk space but are slower to download
than many small files.

### Data-driven selector names using named `clickSelects` and `showSelected` {#data-driven-selectors}

[Chapter 3](/ch03#selecting-with-menus) introduced
`showSelected` for designating a geom which shows only
the selected subset of its data.

[Chapter 4](/ch04#clickSelects-keyword) introduced
`clickSelects` to designate a geom which can be clicked to change
a selection variable.

Usually selector names are defined in `showSelected` or
`clickSelects`. For example, `showSelected=c("year", "country")` means
to create two selection variables (named `year` and
`country`). However, that method becomes
inconvenient if you have many selectors in your data viz. To
illustrate we consider the following theoretical example (the code in
this section is not directly executable). Say you want to use 20
different selector variable names, `selector1value`
... `selector20value`. The usual way to define your data viz would be

```{r, eval=FALSE}
viz <- list(
  points=ggplot()+
    geom_point(clickSelects="selector1value", data=data1)+
    ...
    geom_point(clickSelects="selector20value", data=data20)
)
```

However that method is bad since it violates the DRY principle (Don't
Repeat Yourself). Another way to do that would be to use a for loop:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
viz <- list(points=ggplot())
for(selector.name in paste0("selector", 1:20, "value")){
  data.for.selector <- all.data.list[[selector.name]]
  viz$points <- viz$points +
    geom_point(clickSelects=selector.name, data=data.for.selector)
}
```

That method is bad since it is slow to construct `viz`, and the
compiled viz potentially takes up a lot of disk space since there is
at least one TSV file created for each `geom_point`. The preferable
method is to use a named character vector for `clickSelects`. The
names should be used to indicate the column that contains the selector
variable name. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
viz <- list(
  points=ggplot()+
    geom_point(
      clickSelects=c(selector.name="selector.value"),
      data=all.data)
)
```

The `animint2dir()` compiler looks through the data.frame `all.data` and
create selectors for each of the distinct values of
`all.data$selector.name`. Clicking one of the data points updates the
corresponding selector with the value indicated in
`all.data$selector.value`.

You can similarly use one geom with a named `showSelected` instead of
a bunch of different geoms with `showSelected`.

This feature is useful not only to avoid
repetition in the definition of the data viz, but also because they
are more computationally efficient. For a detailed example with
timings and disk space measurements, see
[Chapter 14](/ch14).

### Specifying how selection state is displayed {#display-selection-state}

Different geoms in `animint2` have sensible defaults for displaying selection state.
In particular, 

* when there is a `rect` or `tile` with `clickSelects`, we use black color/border to show items which are selected, and transparent for items which are not selected.
* for any other geom with `clickSelects`, we use full opacity `alpha` to show items which are selected, and `alpha-0.5` opacity to show items which are not selected.
  
The defaults explained above are illustrated in the first plot
below. Those defaults may be customized by using the `alpha_off`,
`fill_off`, and `color_off` geom parameters as in the code below,

```{r ch06-viz-off}
N <- 3
set.seed(1)
demo_df <- data.frame(i=1:N, num=rnorm(N,2))
animint(
  defaults=ggplot()+
    ggtitle("Defaults, no *_off")+
    geom_tile(aes(
      i, 0),
      size=5,
      clickSelects="i",
      data=demo_df)+
    geom_point(aes(
      i, num),
      size=5,
      clickSelects="i",
      data=demo_df),
  off=ggplot()+
    ggtitle("User specified alpha_off, fill_off, color_off")+
    geom_tile(aes(
      i, 0, fill=i),
      clickSelects="i",
      color="red",
      color_off="pink",
      size=5,
      data=demo_df)+
    geom_point(aes(
      i, num),
      size=5,
      alpha=0.5,
      alpha_off=0.1,
      clickSelects="i",
      data=demo_df)+
    geom_point(aes(
      i, -num),
      size=5,
      alpha=1,
      alpha_off=1,
      color="red",
      color_off="black",
      fill="grey",
      fill_off="white",
      clickSelects="i",
      data=demo_df))
```

Note that when using any one of these visual properties in the `aes`
mapping, it should not be specified as a geom parameter. For example
in the tile above, we used `aes(fill)`, so `fill` and `fill_off`
should not be specified as parameters for that geom (in order to make
it clear that fill is used for displaying data values, not selection
state).

### Specifying guided tour text {#custom-guided-tour}

Since Jan 2025, `animint2` supports a guided tour, which displays
information about possible interactions with each geom. To customize
what is displayed for each geom, you can specify the `help` and
`title` parameters, as in the code below.


```{r ch06-customTour}
animint(
  scatter=ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      x=life.expectancy, y=fertility.rate, color=region),
      size=5,
      showSelected="year",
      clickSelects="country",
      help="One point drawn for each country in the selected year",
      alpha=0.7,
      data=WorldBank)+
    geom_text(aes(
      x=life.expectancy, y=fertility.rate, label=country),
      data=WorldBank,
      title="Selected country",
      showSelected=c("year","country")),
  first=list(
    country="France",
    year=1980))
```

In the code above, we specify `help` for `geom_point`, which controls
the sub-text which is displayed for that geom, after clicking the
"Start Tour" button at the bottom of the data visualization. After
clicking the "Next" button, we can see the `title` that was specified
in the code, shown at the top of the tour window, for the `geom_text`.
This mechanism can be used to provide extra helpful information for
the users of your data visualization, so they can more easily
understand what is displayed, and what interactions are possible.

## Plot-specific options {#plot-options}

This section discusses options which are specific to one ggplot of a data viz.
The `theme_animint` function is used to attach `animint2` options to ggplot objects.

### Plot height and width {#plot-height-width}

The `width` and `height` options are for specifying the dimensions (in
pixels) of a ggplot rendered by `animint2`. For example, consider the
following re-design of the plot of the United States:

```{r ch06-viz-width-height}
animint(
  map=ggplot()+
    theme_animint(width=750, height=500)+
    theme(
      axis.line=element_blank(),
      axis.text=element_blank(), 
      axis.ticks=element_blank(),
      axis.title=element_blank(),
      panel.border=element_blank(),
      panel.background=element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major=element_blank(),
      panel.grid.minor=element_blank())+
    geom_polygon(aes(
      x=long, y=lat, group=group),
      data=USpolygons, fill="black", colour="grey"))
```

Note that the plot above was rendered with a width of 750 pixels and a
height of 500 pixels, due to the `theme_animint` options. If either of
these options is not specified for any ggplot, then `animint2` uses a
default of 400 pixels.

Also note that `theme` was used to specify several blank
elements. This has the effect of removing the axes and background, and
is generally useful for rendering maps.

### HTML table layout {#html-table-layout}

Since summer 2025, `animint2` supports plot layout in an HTML table.
A typical example is when you want to display three linked plots, with one plot to the right of two other plots, as in [this visualization of cross-validation for change-point model selection](https://tdhock.github.io/figure-binseg-cv-most-frequently-selected-fr/).
To specify the HTML table layout, we use three new arguments in `theme_animint()`:

* `rowspan=2` means the plot takes up two rows in the table (default 1).
* `colspan=2` means the plot takes up two columns in the table (default 1).
* `last_in_row=TRUE` means the plot is last in the current row, so the next plot will appear on the next row.
* if none of these are specified in any plots, then we use the classic layout (no HTML table, each plot appears one after the other, and is wrapped to the next row if there is not enough horizontal space).

For example, consider the demo below:

```{r ch06-viz-html-table}
df <- data.frame(x="foo")
animint(
  left=ggplot()+
    theme_animint(width=200, rowspan=2)+
    geom_point(aes(x, x, color=x), data=df),
  topRight=ggplot()+
    theme_animint(width=200, height=200, last_in_row=TRUE)+
    geom_point(aes(x, x, color=x), data=df),
  bottomRight=ggplot()+
    theme_animint(width=200, height=200)+
    geom_point(aes(x, x, color=x), data=df))
```

The visualization above shows one plot on the left, with two plots on the right, as expected.

### Size scale in pixels {#scale-size-animint}

The `scale_size_animint()` scale should be used in all ggplots where you
specify `aes(size)`. To see why, consider the following examples.

```{r ch06-viz-scale-size}
scatter1975 <- ggplot()+
  geom_point(
    aes(x=life.expectancy, y=fertility.rate, size=population),
    WorldBank1975,
    shape=21,
    color="red",
    fill="black")
(viz.scale.size <- animint(
  ggplotDefault=scatter1975+
    ggtitle("no scale specified"),
  animintDefault=scatter1975+
    ggtitle("scale_size_animint()")+
    scale_size_animint(),
  animintOptions=scatter1975+
    ggtitle("scale_size_animint(pixel.range, breaks)")+
    scale_size_animint(pixel.range=c(5, 15), breaks=10^(10:1))))
```

The first ggplot above has no scale specified, so it uses the default
ggplot2 scale, which has two problems. The first problem is that it
seems that all countries have about the same size except the two
really big countries. That problem can be fixed by simply adding
`scale_size_animint()` to the ggplot, which results in the second plot
above. However, a second problem is that the legend entries do not
show the full range of the data. That problem is fixed in the third
plot above, by manually specifying the `breaks` to use for legend
entries. Note that the `pixel.range` argument can also be used to
specify the radius of the largest and smallest circles.

### Axes and legend text size {#axes-legend-text-size}

The syntax of defining axes and legend text size(in pixels) is almost
the same as `ggplot2`. Inside `theme`, you can use numbers directly to
change the font size, or you can use `rel()` to define the relative
size.

```{r ch06-text-size}
scatter1975 <- ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(
    x=life.expectancy, y=fertility.rate, color=region),
    data=WorldBank1975)
(viz.text.size <- animint(
  animintDefault=scatter1975+
    theme_animint(width=500, height=500)+
    ggtitle("no axes and legend size specified"),
  animintAxesOptions=scatter1975+
    theme_animint(width=500, height=500)+
    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20))+
    ggtitle("axis.text=element_text(size=20)"),
  animintLegendOptions=scatter1975+
    theme_animint(width=500, height=500)+
    theme(
      legend.title=element_text(size=24),
      legend.text=element_text(size=rel(2.5)))+
    ggtitle("legend.text=element_text(size=rel(2.5)")))
```

This allows you to change the font size while changing the size of 
the plot to make it look more coherent.

Note that the default font size in `animint2` is 11px for the axes and 
16px for the legend.

## Global data viz options {#global-options}

Global data viz options are any named elements of the `viz` list that are
not ggplots.

### Review of previously introduced global options {#review-global}

[Chapter 3](/ch03#duration-key) introduced the
`duration` option for specifying the duration of smooth transitions.

[Chapter 3](/ch03#animation-time) introduced the
`time` option for specifying a selection variable which is
automatically updated (animation).

[Chapter 4](/ch04#first-option) introduced the
`first` option for specifying the selection when the data viz is first
rendered.

[Chapter 4](/ch04#selector-types-option) introduced
the `selector.types` option for specifying multiple selection
variables.

### Web page title with the title option {#title-option}

The `title` option should be a character string, and will be used to
set the `<title>` element of the web page. It does not make sense to
use the `title` option in an Rmd document such as this page. A title
can and should be used with `animint2dir()`, as in the code below.

```{r ch06-viz-title}
viz.title <- viz.scale.size
viz.title$title <- "Several size scales"
animint2dir(viz.title, "ch06-title")
```

Note that `viz.scale.size` already has three ggplots, each with a
`ggtitle`. Adding the global `title` option has the effect of defining
a title for [the web page](/ch06/ch06-title).

Additionally, when organizing animints in a [gallery](/ch05#gallery), the `title` option is used as the name of the data visualization.

### Link R code with source option {#source-option}

The `source` option should be a character string: a link to the R
source code which was used to create the animint.

```{r ch06-source-demo}
animint(
  demo=ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      Petal.Length, Sepal.Length),
      data=iris),
  source=
    "https://github.com/tdhock/animint-book/edit/master/ch06-other.Rmd")
```

Note above how there is a source link at the bottom of the data viz.

Chapter 5 introduced the [`animint2pages()`](/ch05#pages) function, which is used to publish an animint to GitHub Pages.
By default, it requires that the animint defines the `title` and `source` options, because that meta-data is required for organizing the animint in a [gallery](/ch05#gallery).

### Link a video {#video-option}

The `video` option should be a character string: a link to a video
which shows typical interactions with the animint. This mechanism can
be used to help the users of your data visualization understand what
is displayed, and what interactions they can use.

```{r ch06-link-demo}
animint(
  video="https://vimeo.com/1050117030",
  scatter=ggplot()+
    geom_point(aes(
      x=life.expectancy, y=fertility.rate, color=region),
      clickSelects="country",
      alpha=0.7,
      data=WorldBank1975))
```

In the data visualization above, notice the "video" link which appears
in the bottom right. Clicking that link leads to a video that was
recorded to explain a more complex data visualization based on the
World Bank data. The idea is that you can record a video for each of
your animints, and then include a link to the video using this
mechanism, so your users can more easily understand what is displayed,
and what interactions are possible.

### Show or hide selection menus with the selectize option {#selectize-option}

The selectize option should be a named list of logical values. Names
should be selector variables, and values should indicate whether or
not you would like to render a selection menu via
[selectize.js](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/). By default,
`animint2` will render a selection menu for every selection variable,
with two exceptions:

* data-driven selection variables that are defined using [named
  clickSelects/showSelected
  variables](../ch06/ch06-other.html#data-driven-selectors).
* selection variables that have a lot of values (they are slow to
  render).
  
These defaults should work well for the vast majority of animints. For
those who are interested to see an example of how the `selectize`
option works, please see the
[PredictedPeaks test in the `animint2` source code](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-renderer2-PredictedPeaks.R).
  
## Chapter summary and exercises {#ch06-exercises}

This chapter explained several options for customizing animints at the
observation, geom, plot, and global level.

Exercises:

* Create other versions of `viz.chunk.vars` with different values of
  `chunk_vars` for the `geom_point` and `geom_segment`. How does the
  choice of `chunk_vars` affect the appearance of the visualization?
  The disk space? The loading time?

Next, [Chapter 7](/ch07) explains the limitations of the current implementation of `animint2`.
