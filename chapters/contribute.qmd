# Contributing

This manual has been developed in the open, and it wouldn't be nearly as good without outside contributions.
There are two primary ways you can help make the manual even better.

## Reporting issues {#reporting-issues}

If you don't understand something in this manual, please let us know!
Your feedback on what is confusing or hard to understand is valuable.

* For most issues, please [report an issue](https://github.com/animint/animint-manual-en/issues/new) in public to animint developers in this GitHub repo. The link also appears on the right sidebar of each web page.
* For issues which you would prefer to discuss privately, please [write me an email](mailto:Toby.Hocking@R-Project.org).

## Submitting edits {#submitting-edits}

If you spot a typo, or you know how to fix another issue, then feel free to edit the underlying page, and send a pull request:
  
* Click "<i class="bi bi-github"></i>Edit this page" on the right sidebar.
* Make the changes using github's in-page editor and save.
* Submit a pull request including a brief description of your changes: 
  "fixing typos" is perfectly adequate.
* If you make significant changes, include the phrase "I assign the 
  copyright of this contribution to Toby Dylan Hocking" - 
  I need this so I can publish the printed manual.
