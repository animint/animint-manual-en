# The `showSelected` keyword

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path="ch03-figures/")
```

This chapter explains `showSelected`, one of the two main keywords that
animint introduces for interactive data visualization. After reading
this chapter, you will be able to

* Use the `showSelected` keyword in your plot sketches to specify geoms
  for which only a subset of data should be plotted at any time.
* Use selection menus in animint to change the subset of plotted data.
* Specify smooth transitions between data subsets using the duration
  option and key aesthetic.
* Create animated data visualizations using the time option.

## Sketching with `showSelected` {#sketching-with-showSelected}

In this section, we will explain how the `showSelected` keyword can be
used in plot sketches. The `showSelected` keyword specifies a variable
to use for subsetting the data before plotting. Each geom in a data
visualization has its own data set, and its own definition of
`showSelected` variables. That means different geoms can specify
different data sets and `showSelected` keywords to show different data
subsets.

In fact, we have already used the `showSelected` keyword, which was
automatically created by the interactive legends that we created in
the previous two chapters. For example, consider the sketch below of
the [Keeling Curve data visualization from Chapter 1](/#large-data).

![Sketch of data visualization of carbon dioxide over time](ch03-viz-co2.png)

The sketch above can be translated to the R code below.

```r
ggplot(co2, aes(time, ppm))+
  geom_point(aes(color=month), showSelected="month")+
  geom_line()
```

The code above includes `showSelected="month"` for the `geom_point()`, meaning that it should show the subset of data for the selected months.
In contrast, since the `geom_line()` does not include `showSelected`, it always shows the entire data set (regardless of the selected months).

As another example, consider the sketch below of the first WorldBank data visualization from Chapter 2.

![Sketch of World Bank data visualization with `showSelected`](ch03-viz-showSelectedColor.png)

The sketch above can be translated to the R code below.

```r
ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(
    life.expectancy, fertility.rate, color=Region),
    data=world_bank_1975,
    showSelected="Region")
```

The code above specifies `showSelected="Region"` for the `geom_point()`, meaning that it should show the subset of data for the selected regions.
Note that the code we used in chapter 2 did not explicitly specify `showSelected="Region"`.
Instead, we specified `aes(color=Region)`, and `animint2` automatically added `showSelected`.
In general, animint will add `showSelected` for each variable that is used in a categorical legend.

However, the `showSelected` keyword is not limited to use with categorical legends.
You can use `showSelected` keywords for any data variables you like, by explicitly specifying the variable names in the `showSelected` argument of the geom.
Each variable that is used with `showSelected` is treated by `animint2` as a *selection variable*. For example, the Keeling Curve data viz has one selection variable (`month`), and so does the World Bank data viz (`Region`).
For each selection variable, `animint2` keeps track of the currently selected values.
When the selection changes, `animint2` updates the subset of data that is shown.

Each of the data visualizations sketched above has only one selection
variable. However, a data visualization can have any number of
selection variables. In the next section, we will explore a
visualization of the World Bank data that has selection variables for
`region` and `year`.

## Selecting data subsets using menus {#selecting-with-menus}

Consider the following sketch which adds a `showSelected` variable,
and changes the data set. 

![Sketch of WorldBank data visualization with `showSelected`](ch03-viz-scatter.png)

Note that there are two `showSelected` variables, `region` and
`year`. Also note that the data is specified as all years (but only
one will be shown at a time due to `showSelected=year`). Below, we
translate this sketch into R code.

```{r}
library(animint2)
data(WorldBank)
scatter <- ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(
    x=life.expectancy, y=fertility.rate, color=region),
    showSelected="year",
    data=WorldBank)
scatter
```

Note that the ggplot above contains the `showSelected` argument, one
of the two main features introduced in `animint2`. The `showSelected`
keyword is ignored when rendering the plot using the usual R graphics
devices, which produce a scatterplot with one point for every country
and year. Note that since `color=region` was specified, animint also
automatically uses `region` as a `showSelected` variable.

In constrast, rendering the same ggplot using animint yields the
interactive data visualization below.

```{r ch03-viz-scatter}
animint(scatter)
```

Note that the data viz above has two selection variables: region and
year. Each variable has a menu at the bottom of the data viz that can
be used to change the current selection. In this data viz, these
selection menus are shown by default. They can be hidden by clicking
the "Hide selection menus" button, and shown again by clicking the
"Show selection menus" button.

Discrete legend variables such as region default to multiple
selection, so several values are selected and shown at once. **Try**
changing the selected region in the interactive legend and the
selection menu. When you change the selection using either method,
both the interactive legend and the selection menu should update to
reflect the current selection.

We use the terms "direct manipulation" and "indirect manipulation" to
describe these different ways of changing the selection. Direct
manipulation typically involves clicking on the objects that you want
to change, and is usually easier to understand. In contrast, indirect
manipulation techniques such as menus are typically more complicated
to understand. In the animint above, you can change the value of the
`region` variable using either the legend or the menu. Using the
legend is a more direct manipulation technique, since the legend is
drawn closer to the plotted data points that will be updated.

Other selection variables such as year default to single selection, so
only one value is selected and shown at any time. **Try** changing the
selected value of the year variable using the selection menu. You
should see the points in the scatterplot immediately update to show
the fertility rate and life expectancy of all the countries in the
year that you selected.

**Multi-layer exercise:** Add another geom to this interactive
scatterplot. As in [Chapter 2](/ch02#multi-layer), you can
use a `geom_text()` to show the name of each country (easy), or a
`geom_text()` to show the selected year (medium), or a `geom_path()` to
show the previous 5 years of data (hard). Hint: make sure to specify
`showSelected=year` for all geoms.

**Multi-plot exercise:** Add a time series plot to the data viz
above. As in [Chapter 2](../ch02/ch02-ggplot2.html#multi-plot), you can use a
`geom_line()` to show the fertility rate for each country over all
years. Add a `geom_vline()` with `showSelected=year` to highlight the
currently selected year.

## Transitions: the duration option and key aesthetic {#duration-key}

You may have noticed that there are buttons at the bottom of each data
visualization created by animint. Try clicking the "Show animation
controls" button above. This table contains a row for each selection
variable. The text boxes show the number of milliseconds that are used
for transition durations after updating each selection variable. The
default transition duration for each selection variable is 0, meaning
data will be immediately placed at their new positions after updating
each variable.

To illustrate the significance of transition durations, **try**
changing the transition duration of the year variable to 2000. Then,
change the selected value of the year variable. You should see the
data points move slowly to their new positions, over a duration of 2
seconds.

Some transitions result in points moving only a little bit, to nearby
positions (e.g. 1979-1980). Other transitions result in points moving
a lot more, to far away locations (e.g. 1980-1981). Why is that?

Smooth transitions only make sense for data points that exist both
before and after changing the selection. In the R code below we
compute a table of counts of data points that can be plotted in each
of these three years.

```{r}
three.years <- subset(WorldBank, 1979 <= year & year <= 1981)
can.plot <- with(three.years, {
  (!is.na(life.expectancy)) & (!is.na(fertility.rate))
})
table(three.years$year, can.plot)
```

It is clear from the table above that there are 187 points that can be
plotted in 1979 and 1980. However, in 1981 there is one more data
point, corresponding to a country for which we did not have data in
1980. Below we show the data for that country, Kosovo.

```{r}
subset(three.years, country=="Kosovo")
```

Indeed, the table above shows that fertility rate and life expectancy
are missing for Kosovo during 1979-1980. Thus it does not make sense
to do a smooth transition for countries such as Kosovo which would not
be plotted either before or after the transition. How to specify that
in the data visualization? In the code below, we use
`aes(key=country)` to specify that the `country` variable should be
used to match data points before and after changing the selection.

```{r}
scatter.key <- ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(
    x=life.expectancy, y=fertility.rate, color=region,
    key=country),
    showSelected="year",
    data=WorldBank)
```

The `key` aesthetic in the ggplot above is only meaningful for
interactive data visualization, so it ignored when rendering with the
usual R graphics devices. 
However, if we render this ggplot using `animint2`, the `country` variable will be used to make sure transtion durations are meaningful. 
To specify a default transition duration for the `year` variable, we use the `duration` option in the data viz below.

```{r ch03-viz-duration}
(viz.duration <- animint(scatter.key, duration=list(year=2000)))
```

The `duration` option must be a named list. Each name should be a
selection variable, and each value should specify the number of
milliseconds to use for a transition duration when the selected value
of that variable is changed.

If you click "Show animation controls" in the data viz above, you will
see that the text box for the year variable is 2000, as specified in
the R code. If you change the selection from 1980 to 1981, you should
see a proper transition.

In general the `key` aesthetic should be specified for all geoms that
use `showSelected` with a variable that appears in the `duration`
option. In this example, we used the `duration` option to specify a
smooth transition for the `year` variable. Since we use
`showSelected=year` in the `geom_point()`, we also specified the `key`
aesthetic for this geom.

## Animation: the time option {#animation-time}

The `time` option is used to specify a variable to use for animation.
The code below specifies `year` as the variable to animate over time, with an update every 2000 milliseconds.

```{r ch03-viz-duration-time}
viz.duration.time <- viz.duration
viz.duration.time$time <- list(variable="year", ms=2000)
viz.duration.time
```

The data visualization above is animated, because the selected year advances every two seconds.
There are several animation controls that are available if you click the "Show animation controls" button:

* To pause the animation, click the "Pause" button (which then changes to "Play").
* To re-start animation, click the "Play" button.
* To control the animation delay, type a new number of milliseconds per update in the "updates" box, then type Return/Enter.
* If you edit the animation delay (updates box) or smooth transition durations (other boxes), make sure that the animation delay is greater than the other boxes (so the smooth transition can finish before the next animation update).

**Exercise:** make an animated data visualization that does NOT use
smooth transitions. Hint: make a list of ggplots that has the `time`
option but no `duration` option.

## Chapter summary and exercises {#ch03-exercises}

This chapter explained the `showSelected` keyword, selection menus,
transition durations, and animation.

Exercises:

* Make an improved version of `viz.aligned` from the previous
  chapter. Instead of fixing the year at 1975, use
  `showSelected=year` so that the user can select a year. Add
  geoms that show the selected year: a `geom_text()` on the scatterplot,
  and a `geom_vline()` on the time series.
* Translate one of the
  animation package examples [@animation_package_examples]
  to an animint. Hint: in the code for the animation package there is
  always a for loop over the time variable. Instead of calling a
  plotting function inside the for loop, use the
  [list of data tables idiom](/ch99#list-of-data-tables)
  to store the data that should be plotted. Then use those data along
  with `showSelected` to create ggplots, and render them
  using animint.

Next, [Chapter 4](/ch04) explains the `clickSelects`
keyword, which indicates a geom that can be clicked to update a
selection variable.
